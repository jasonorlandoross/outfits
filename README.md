###Dress Me

##Technology Used
#HTML, JavaScript, CSS

##App Description 
#Dress Me is an application for those out there who are a little indecisive when it comes to clothing and getting ready for the day!

#This app is heavily inspired by the hit movie Clueless. Specifically the scene where the main character, Cher, is getting ready in the morning and picking out her school clothes. 

#You will eventually be able to enter descriptions and photos of clothing items from your closet such as your tops, bottoms & shoes. Eventually id love to make it to where you can also add your jewerlery, socks, hats, bags and other accessories to the application as well. You can then click a "Browse" button and browse through your clothing items! Say you sell a clothing item or grow out of it you'll be able to edit and/or delete items. 

#You will eventually be able to click a "Dress Me" button and then the application will pull a random top, bottom & pair of shoes to assemble your outfit for the day!
